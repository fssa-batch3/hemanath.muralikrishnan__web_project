## About AgroKart 

Agriculture is the backbone of India. We all know how the farmers are facing many issues at this time. I am going to create a web application to help farmers. The major problem faced by farmers was that they couldnâ€™t get fair prices for their vegetables and fruits. And also, they are facing transportation problems while getting cultivated vegetables and selling them in the market. They need four-wheeler vehicles to bring the produced vegetables to the wholesale market or daily market. If the cultivated crops are in massive amounts.
