Before I wrote an examination for the FSSA, I needed clarification in that state. I don't have any specific goal. Before getting selected for FSSA. After getting selected for FSSA. I realized I had some talents and skills, so they chose me. So, I want to find out what those things are and work on them. While we attended the online classes, I needed clarification about what we would do. I have a lot of responsibilities and take care of myself without any other's help. After coming to the academy, I started to follow things I was already following to get into my comfort zone. I pick some things that I want to always follow in my life. Whatever work I did, I didn't give my best and time for that work. We always want to provide the required time to do the job. Otherwise, it will be affected in the future, or you may want to redo your work. As of now, I didn't give the best part of myself. In the upcoming times, I will provide the best part of myself in all the works. I would do better If I had a better squad and returns for the efforts that I am giving right now. If something I am teaching or sharing knowledge or my experience, I always expect returns from the opposite person. They also have some experiences and knowledge, but they didn't share it with me. Some people always come and tell me you speak like Mahan. But you didn't do anything in your life but talk only. And some people gather some knowledge or experience from me, showing me there arrogant. After some time, they will come and speak like a Mahan. In my life, I always want to have two things: learning and health. That's it. Thank you for your time.
