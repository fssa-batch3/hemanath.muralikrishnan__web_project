  "description": "Agriculture is the backbone of India. We all know how the farmers are facing many issues at this time. I am going to create a web application to help farmers. The major problem faced by farmers was that they couldnâ€™t get fair prices for their vegetables and fruits. And also, they are facing transportation problems while getting cultivated vegetables and selling them in the market.
